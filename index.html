    <!-- Our story -->
    <div class="container">
      <p>Immigrant advocate groups gathered outside JPMorgan Chase in Manhattan, New York, in September 2018 to protest the company's investment in the immigration detention industry. </p>
      <p>The coalition, #FamiliesBelongTogether, called out Jaime
        Dimon, CEO
        of JPMorgan Chase, for continuing to fund private prison companies like GEO Group and CoreCivic. </p>

      <p>"He wants to keep saying he is a friend of the immigrants. But we know he’s a liar," said Marilyn Mendoza, a community engagement specialist with Make the Road New York, in her speech. <p>

          <p>Both CoreCivic and GEO Group operate detention facilities on behalf of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Yatziri Tovar, spokesperson for Make the Road New York, explained that the coalition came together after children of
            illegal immigrants were separated from their
            parents and held at detention centers. "The purpose of this campaign is to expose Wall Street companies that are making a profit out of Trump's zero tolerance policy," said Tovar.
          </p>

          <p>According to a report released by In the Public Interest, a research and policy center based in California, CoreCivic borrowed $65.4 million dollars from JPMorgan Chase in 2016. The company is also a part of the syndicate banks from
            which
            the GEO Group borrowed $450 million dollars.</p>

      <p>Another report by the Center for Popular Democracy found that JPMorgan Chase's holdings in the GEO Group jumped by almost 180 percent after Trump took office. The coalition lined up outside
        JPMorgan Chase's offices to deliver their petitions to a company representative. They then held a vigil for Mariee Juárez, an 18-month-old girl who died after contracting a virus at a private detention center run by CoreCivic in
        Dilley,
        Texas.
      </p>

      <p>"We want to show the human face of the crisis that this bank is financing," said Mendoza.</p>

      <p>More than 400,000 petitions were delivered to JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo locations across all 50 states, organizers said. </p>

      <p>"We're seeing so many immigrants running for their lives and being met by closed borders and
        that
        is outrageous," said Ann Toback, executive director of The Workmen’s Circle, "We're going to fight until our borders are open to everyone who's
        looking for hope and respite and freedom."
